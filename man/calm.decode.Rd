\title{Decode Coding Matrix into Hypothesis Matrix}
\usage{
calm.decode(X, digits = 4)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A coded matrix (typically output from \code{\link{calm.encode}}).}

\item{digits}{Integer. Number of decimal places to round the result. Defaults to 4.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix representing the decoded hypothesis matrix. Row names are labeled \code{"HYPOTH #"}, and column names as \code{"GROUP #"}.
}
\description{
Recovers the hypothesis matrix from a coded contrast matrix.
}
\details{
This function inverts the encoding process via least-squares pseudoinverse. 
This reconstructs a hypothesis matrix from the coding matrix.
