## Producing Common Contrast Codes

`CALM` can take a set of linear contrasts to be tested and encode them
into coding schemes. The examples below take some common contrasts
(treatment, control, deviation, etc.) and produce the coding scheme
associated with it.

The package takes linear contrast weights (rows represented the weights
for the groups, columns represent the different groups) and provides the
coding pattern (where columns represent vector codes, rows represent the
groups).

### Treatment (First) Contrasts

For this set of hypotheses, the intercept is equivalent to mean of the
first group. The additional parameters represent the difference between
each group and the first group.

``` r
M1 <- c(1,0,0)
H1 <- c(-1,1,0)
H2 <- c(-1,0,1)
ex_treatment.first <- rbind(M1,H1,H2)
calm.encode(ex_treatment.first)
```

    ##         M1 H1 H2

    ## GROUP 2  1  1  0
    ## GROUP 3  1  0  1

For this set of hypotheses, the intercept is equivalent to mean of the
last group. The additional parameters represent the difference between
each group and the last group.

H2 <- c(0,1,-1)
ex_treatment.last <- rbind(M3,H1,H2)
