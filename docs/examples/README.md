## Examples for CALM

### Overview

`CALM` is an R package for creating and interpreting contrast codes for linear models. In addition to providing built-in codes, it includes functions for directly converting hypothesized differences (contrasts) into linear model codes (and vice versa).

### Extracting Hypotheses from Codes

`CALM` can take existing coding patterns and decode them to determine the hypotheses being tested. 

- [`extractingHypotheses`](./extractingHypotheses.md) - Examples from common regression and R contrast codes

### Producing Contrast Codes

`CALM` can take a set of linear contrasts to be tested and encode them into coding schemes. 

- [`producingCodes`](./producingCodes.md) - Examples for commonly specified and custom contrasts

### Using Contrast Codes

`CALM` includes a complete set of commonly used coding schemes that can be used directly in linear model specifications. 

- [`usingContrasts`](./usingContrasts.md) - Examples using the package's built-in coding and custom coding schemes
